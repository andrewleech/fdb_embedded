Version 0.9.1
=============

Just bugfixes to make FDB work on P3K again.

Version 0.9
===========

New Features
------------

- Documentation; both in-source (in Sphinx autodoc format) and Sphinx (html)
- Services API completely reworked

Other changes
-------------

- Unregistered bugs fixed.
- Various optimizations and cleanup
- Object reference graph optimalizations
- Many new tests in test suite

Version 0.8.5
=============

New Features
------------

- Support for Firebird stream BLOBs (see ReleaseNotes for details)
- Documentation (stub, from KInterbasDB 3.3.0)

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Fix for PYFB-17 and PYFB-18 (see our JIRA tracker for details)
- Fixes for automatic unicode conversions + refactoring
- Some optimizations


Version 0.8
===========

New Features
------------

- Support for Firebird Event Notifications - `JIRA entry <http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/PYFB-8>`

Bugs Fixes
----------

- database_info (isc_info_firebird_version) fails opn amd64 linux - `JIRA entry <http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/PYFB-16>`
- more than 2 consecutive cursor open execute and iter fail - `JIRA entry <http://tracker.firebirdsql.org/browse/PYFB-15>`


Version 0.7.2
=============

New Features
------------

- Python 3 Support (thanks to Philippe Makowski)
- Support for Distributed Transactions

And as always, some (unregistered) bugs fixed.

Version 0.7.1
=============

Bug fixes.

Version 0.7
===========

Initial release.

Almost feature-complete (ready for 95% of users), but it could be still buggy (it’s beta!), and the 
code wasn’t optimized for size and speed. In all other ways it’s ready for wide testing.

What’s missing
--------------

- Distributed transactions
- ARRAY support
- EVENTs support
- Stream BLOBs
- TRACE service
- Documentation (but you can use KInterbasDB one as FDB is as close to it as possible).
- Python 3.x support (haven’t had time to test it, but it shouldn’t be hard to make it work there)
