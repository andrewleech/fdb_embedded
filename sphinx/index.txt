#######################################
Welcome to KInterbasDB's documentation!
#######################################

KInterbasDB is a `Python <http://python.org>`__ extension package that
implements `Python Database API 2.0`-compliant support for the open source relational
database `Firebird® <http://www.firebirdsql.org>`__ and some versions of its
proprietary cousin `Interbase® <http://www.interbase.com>`__.
In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API,
KInterbasDB also exposes nearly the entire native client API of the database engine.

KInterbasDB is free -- covered by a permissive BSD-style `license
<license.html>`__ that both commercial and noncommercial users should
find agreeable.

This documentation set is not a tutorial on Python, SQL, or Firebird;
rather, it is a topical presentation of KInterbasDB's feature set,
with example code to demonstrate basic usage patterns. For detailed
information about Firebird features, see the `Firebird documentation 
<http://www.firebirdsql.org/index.php?op=doc>`__, and especially the excellent
`The Firebird Book <http://www.ibphoenix.com/main.nfs?a=ibphoenix&page=ibp_firebird_book>`__ 
written by Helen Borrie and published by APress.
